We use the term radius of curvature even when the motion isn't exactly in a circle. For any point on a curve, the radius of curvature is 1 / k. In other words, the radius of curvature is the radius of a circle with the same instantaneous curvature as the curve.

    k = 1 / radius of curvature

For an object with position function r(t),
the acceleration at the point r(t) decomposes into tangential and normal components

    a(t) = v'(t)T(t) + k(t)v(t)^2N(t)

where the speed v(t) = ||r'(t)|| and acceleration a(t) = r''(t).

Consequently, for an object moving in space the component of acceleration tangential to the trajectory of motion is the change in speed, while the normal component depends on curvature. Notice that

1. For a straight line k(t) = 0, so If the object is moving in a straight line the only acceleration comes from the rate of change of speed. The acceleration vector a(t) = v'(t)T(t) then lies in the tangential direction.
2. If the object is moving with constant speed along a curved path, then dv/dt = 0, so there is no tangential component of acceleration. The acceleration vector a(t) = k(t)v(t)^2N(t) lies in the normal direction. The magnitude of the acceleration is often written as v^2/R, where R is the radius of curvature.
Motion in general will combine tangential and normal acceleration.
